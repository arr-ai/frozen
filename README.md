Efficient immutable data types.

## Types

Map and Set both use a [hashed array map trie
(HAMT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie).

- Map: Associates keys with values.
- Set: Stores sets of values.

## Bugs

Efficiency is aspirational for now. Performance testing is in the future.
